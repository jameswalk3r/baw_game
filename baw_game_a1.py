#Core Ideas
#Player selects Race and Class.
#Class = How fast certain skills level up and slight skill boosts.

#Skill levels 1-50; Race gives boosts to cetain skills.
#Skills: Combat, Stealth, Magic, and Speech
#Genetic Skills level by +10, class by +5, use by +1.
#Level Speed is for Non-Genetic Skills.

#Races: Human(2), Elven(2), Half-Blood(1)
#Human 1: Well-rounded; not best in any skills. Level speed slow.
#Human 2: Low Stealth, high Speech. Level up speed medium.
#Elven 1: Low Combat, high Magic. Level up speed medium/fast.
#Elven 2: Low Combat, high Stealth. Level up speed medium.
#Half-Blood: Low stealth, high magic. Level speed medium.
